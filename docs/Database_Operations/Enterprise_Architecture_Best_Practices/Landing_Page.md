## Enterprise Data Guidance

Jack Henry & Associates product groups require multiple types of data systems to efficiently and effectively provide applications and services. Guidance is necessary to enable product development management for selecting and adopting the right technology to meet current and future expectations. The included documentation is the overall guidance for the Jack Henry Database platforms and data patterns. This guidance content outlines various recommendations, behaviors, and key decisions related to data platforms and usage specific to JHA. Every effort has been made to choose industry standards where they exist and to not deviate unless needed.

## Purpose and Targets Audience
  
Provide an overview of data system capabilities to enable development managers and software architects to determine how a platform can meet their application and business requirements.

## Recommendations

Different sections of the documents will have a Recommendations section with a numbering format for easier understanding and clarity. The format will consist of the technology that the document covers as a first letter with CR added (Configuration Recommendation) then the section and a chronological numbering, the minimum version of the software that this recommendation supports, and then additionally the date this recommendation was made in YYYYMMDD format. The chronological number will increase in the current document but reset for each document.
