# Regulatory Questions Often Posed to DBOps

## Regulatory Bodies
DBOps frequently responds to regulators including but not limited to:
* PCI - jhapps; pshtwr; jkhy
* FFIEC (FBA) - jkhy; jhacorp
* SOC
* SOC2
* SOX - jhacorp - specifically Peoplesoft HCM and FSCM

## Regualtory Ruquests and Responses
### Requests
While frequently bypasses, TS-Compliance Operations should be the first source for regulartory requests.  This team ensures all requests are tracked and sent to responsibile parties to complete in a timely manner

### Responses
Regulatory responses must be submitted to DBOps Management prior to providing to internal or external auditors.  This ensures all relevants details are included but also that requests follow a consistent format.

#### Controls
Regulators traditionally ask for what controls are in places.  
##### SOX 
SOX Reporting is typically handled via Internal Audit with assistance from multiple BU's.  A list of all SOX controls and process narratives can be found at https://jackhenry.sharepoint.com/sites/CAS-EngagementManager/SOX.  
SOX controls are tested quarterly by IA and typically include requests to validate process narratives and usally require live demonstrations to test controls for backups, backup restoration, notification of SQL job failures and database encryption.
