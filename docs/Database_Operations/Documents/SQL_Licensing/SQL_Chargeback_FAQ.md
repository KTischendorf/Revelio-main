# SQL Server Chargeback FAQ

## FAQ's

### How does the chargeback for a SQL licensed host work? 
The cost is shared with all tenants on the host/cluster and allows all tenants to use SQL Enterprise, thus reducing the overall cost.

### Can I downgrade SQL versions to reduce cost? 
SQL Versions cannot be downgraded without a full un-install and re-install. You can upgrade versions of SQL without any issues. ie: wanting to downgrade from 
SQL Enterprise to Devloper, a complete un-install and re-install is required.
