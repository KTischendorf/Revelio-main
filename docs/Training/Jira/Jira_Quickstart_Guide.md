# How to Use Jira: A Quickstart Guide


## 1. Understanding Jira Basics


* **What is [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/getting-started/introduction#what-is-jira-software)?** Jira is a project management tool used for tracking work items, issues, and bugs.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **[Projects](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/projects/overview#what-is-a-jira-project):** A container used to organize and track those tasks, or issues across the entire team.
    * **[Issues](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/issues/overview#what-is-an-issue):** Represent tasks, bugs, or other work items within a project.
    * **[Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/workflows/overview#what-is-a-jira-workflow):** Define the steps an issue goes through (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).


## 2. Navigating Jira


* **[Dashboard](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-a-jira-dashboard/):** Your starting point, showing relevant project activity.
* **[Projects](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/projects/overview#what-is-a-jira-project):** View and access your projects.
* **Issues:** Create, view, and edit issues.
* **[Boards](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/boards/overview#what-is-a-jira-board):** Visualize project progress using Kanban or Scrum boards.


## 3. Creating and Managing Issues


* **Create an Issue:** Select “Create” in the top navigation and fill in the issue details including the summary, description, assignee, and any other relevant fields. Before assigning the issue, make sure to add it to the backlog. This helps in organizing and prioritizing tasks effectively. When creating an issue, use[ T-shirt sizing](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing) (e.g., XS, S, M, L, XL) to estimate the effort required. This helps in planning and allocating resources efficiently.
* **Assign an Issue:** Select the assignee from the dropdown menu. Ensure that the issue is assigned to the appropriate team member who is responsible for handling it. Assigning issues promptly helps in maintaining a clear workflow and accountability within the team.
* **Transition an Issue:**  Move the issue through the workflow stages, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." This ensures that the issue's status is always up-to-date and visible to the team. Each stage in the workflow represents a different phase of the issue's lifecycle, and transitioning issues helps in tracking progress and identifying bottleneck
* **Adding Comments:** Collaborate by adding comments to issues. Use comments to provide updates, ask questions, or share additional information with team members. Comments are a great way to keep everyone informed and engaged in the issue resolution process.
* **Attaching Files**: Upload relevant files to the issue. This can include links to relevant GitHub repositories or Google Docs in the issue. This can encompass screenshots, documents, or any other supporting materials that can assist in resolving the issue. Providing links ensures that all necessary information is readily accessible to the team members working on the issue.
* **Viewing the Backlog:** The backlog is a list of all the issues that need to be addressed. It is essential to regularly review and prioritize the backlog to ensure that the most critical issues are addressed first. The backlog can be filtered and sorted based on various criteria, such as priority, due date, and assignee
* **Creating Epics and User Stories:** An epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks or user stories. While we are not currently using Epics and User Stories, as we mature our planning and project management, we do intend to use these to further enhance our planning and execution abilities. Creating epics helps in organizing and managing large projects more effectively. User stories are smaller, manageable pieces of work that contribute to the completion of an epic. Each user story should have a clear description, acceptance criteria, and estimated effort


### **Best Practices:**


* Prioritize Issues: Ensure that high-priority issues are addressed first. Use the priority field to indicate the importance of each issue. Additionally, discuss and review these priorities during your weekly or bi-weekly standups to ensure alignment and timely resolution.
* Regular Updates: Keep issues updated with the latest information, including status changes, comments, and attachments.
* Collaborate: Use Jira's commenting and @mention features to collaborate with team members and keep everyone informed.


## 4. Using Boards



* **Kanban Board:** Visualize workflow stages and move issues across columns.
    * **Task Management:** Create tasks for various activities, such as developing new features, fixing bugs, or conducting security audits. Each task can be assigned to a team member, prioritized, and given a due date.
    * **Workflow Visualization:** By moving tasks across the columns, the status of each task can be easily viewed and identify any bottlenecks in the process. This helps in maintaining a clear and organized workflow.
    * **Collaboration:** Team members can add comments and attachments to tasks, making it easy to collaborate and provide additional context. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and can easily share updates or ask questions.
    * **Prioritization:** The backlog can be regularly reviewed and prioritized to ensure that the most critical tasks are addressed first. This helps in maintaining focus on high-priority items and ensures that the team is working on the most important tasks.
    * **Tracking Progress:** Kanban boards allow progress tracking of tasks in real-time. This helps in identifying any delays or issues that need to be addressed and ensures that the project stays on track.
    * **Continuous Improvement:** By regularly reviewing the Kanban board, the team can identify areas for improvement and make adjustments to their workflow. This helps in optimizing processes and improving overall efficiency.


## 5. Searching and Filtering


* **Searching for Issues:**
    * **Basic Search: **Use the basic search to quickly find issues by entering keywords in the search bar. You can filter results by project, issue type, status, assignee, and more.
    * **Advanced Search (JQL):** For more complex queries, use Jira Query Language (JQL). This allows you to create custom searches using specific criteria. For example, project = "PROJ" AND status = "Open" AND assignee = currentUser().
    * **Saved Searches:** Save your frequent searches for easy access. You can save a search by clicking on the "Save as" button after performing a search.
* **Filtering Issues**
    * **Quick Filters:** Use quick filters on your board to view issues based on predefined criteria, such as "My Issues" or "Recently Updated".
    * **Custom Filters:** Create custom filters to narrow down your search results. You can add multiple criteria, such as priority, labels, and due dates.
    * **Filter by Columns:** On the issue navigator, you can filter issues by clicking on the column headers. This allows you to sort issues by fields like priority, status, and assignee.
* **Using Filters in Dashboards:**
    * **Gadgets:** Add gadgets to your dashboard to display filtered issues. For example, use the "Filter Results" gadget to show issues from a specific filter.
    * **Customizing Gadgets:** Customize your gadgets to display the information you need. You can configure the gadget settings to show specific fields, sort order, and more.
* **Best Practices:**
    * **Consistent Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for your filters and saved searches. This makes it easier to find and reuse them.
    * **Regular Updates:** Regularly update your filters to ensure they reflect the current state of your projects and tasks.
    * **Sharing Filters:** Share your filters with your team to promote collaboration and ensure everyone has access to the same information.


## 6. Additional Tips


* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Speed up your workflow with keyboard shortcuts.
* **Notifications:** Stay updated with email notifications or in-app alerts.
* **Integrations:** Connect Jira with other tools your team uses.
* **Help Resources:** Access Jira [documentation and support](https://www.atlassian.com/resources).
