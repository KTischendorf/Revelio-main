**Jira Board Management Standards**

**Hygiene Expectations for Project Boards**


* **Daily Grind Board/Operational Excellence Boards:**
    * Naming Convention should be in the following format: Group Name: Daily Grind (e.g., HPS: Operational Excellence).
    * [Task Size:](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing) Operations boards are designated for small to medium t-shirt sized projects or tasks. Large to extra-large projects will be assigned their own epic under that groupâ€™s Engineer board with approval of  senior management.
    
* **Large Project Naming Conventions:**
    * Use clear and consistent naming conventions for cards,  projects, and components. 
    * Avoid using ambiguous or generic names that can cause confusion.
    * Naming Conventions should be in the following format: Group Name: Project Name (e.g., HPS: Obsolete Tech 2016).
      
* **Proper Documentation:**
    * Ensure that all child tasks are assigned to the appropriate team members. Each task should have a clear owner responsible for its completion.
    * All cards should contain detailed descriptions, including the problem statement, steps to reproduce, and expected outcomes. 
    * Clearly define the priority of each task. High-priority tasks should be marked accordingly to ensure they receive the necessary attention.
    * Team members should use the comment section for discussions, questions, and updates related to the task to foster collaboration and keep everyone informed.
    * Set realistic due dates for tasks and ensure they are adhered to. This helps in managing timelines and meeting project deadlines.
    * Attach relevant documents, links, screenshots, or logs to provide additional context and support.
      
* **Timely Resolution:**
    * Prioritize and address high-priority tickets promptly to avoid delays and bottlenecks.
    * Regularly review and update the status of tickets to reflect their current state and progress.
      
* **Automation and Integration:**
    * Leverage automation rules and integrations to streamline workflows and reduce manual effort. Ensure these rules are regularly reviewed and updated to remain effective.
    * Monitor and address any automation failures promptly to avoid disruptions in the workflow.
      
* **Task Management:**
    * Status Updates
        * Regular Updates: Regularly update the status of tasks to reflect their current progress.
        * Status Labels: Use appropriate status labels such as "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," and "Done."
    * [Epics vs. Issues vs. Sub-Tasks](https://community.atlassian.com/forums/App-Central-articles/Jira-Terms-and-Definitions-for-Beginners-from-A-Z-Weekly/ba-p/2285173)
        * Epics: Represent major milestones or deliverables.
        * Issues: Include Stories, Tasks, and Bugs, representing individual pieces of work within an Epic.
        * Sub-Tasks: Break down Issues into smaller, manageable pieces.

    * Sizing
        * Appropriate Sizing: Ensure tasks are appropriately sized to be completed within a defined timeframe. Avoid creating tasks that are too large or too small to maintain a balanced workflow.
        * T-Shirt Analogy: Use the t-shirt analogy for task sizing:
            * Small or Medium Tasks: Likely appropriate for an Issue.
            * Large Tasks: Should be broken into smaller Sub-Tasks.
              
    * Well-Defined Tasks
        * Specificity: Clearly define what a well-defined task looks like.
        * Example: A small or medium task is likely appropriate for an Issue, while a large task should be broken into smaller Sub-Tasks.
          
* **Regular Updates and Maintenance:**
    * Ensure all Jira tickets are updated regularly with the latest status, comments, and attachments. 
    * Regularly review and clean up old or inactive tickets to avoid clutter and ensure the system remains efficient.
    * Update cards at least once a week or when there is a significant change in status.
      
* **Regular Audits and Reviews:**
    * Conduct monthly audits and reviews of Jira projects and VTBs to ensure compliance with hygiene standards, preferably updating as relevant changes occur to maintain the integrity of the board.
    * Identify and address any gaps or areas for improvement to maintain a high level of efficiency and effectiveness.
